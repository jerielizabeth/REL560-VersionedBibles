“Sit down here." So they sat down.
3 Then he said to the ‘closest relative, “Naomi, who has 3'Lit.,redeemer
come back from the land of Moab, has to sell the piece of land “L” Z515
“which belonged to our brother Eliinelech.
4 “So I thought to linform you, saying, ‘Buy it before
those who are sitting here, and before the elders of my people.
lf you will redeem it, redeem it; but if 2110i‘, tell me that I may 4 ]Lit.,uncoveryourear
know; for there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am after ZL"""°°"" “”"’d“"’
you.‘ " And he said, “l will redeem it."
5 Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the ﬁeld from
the hand of \’aomi, you must also acquire Ruth the l\/Ioabit-
ess, the widow of the deceased, in order to raise up the name 6lLit.,redeemerZLit.,
of the deceased on his inheritance.”  25:2;
6 And “the lelosest relative said, “l cannot redeem it for
myself, lest l 2ieopardi7.e my own inheritance. Redeem it for
yourself; you may have my right of redemption, for I cannot
redeem it."
7 Now this was “the custom in former times in Israel 7’De“‘-251840
concerning the redemption and the exchange of land to eon»
firm any matter: a man removed his sandal and gave it to
another; and this was the manner of attestation in Israel.
8 So the lclosest relative said to Boaz, “Buy it for yoiir- i;iL,t__,edeeme,
self." And he removed his sandal.
9 Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You
are witiiesses today that l have bought from the hand of
Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to I _
Chilion and Mahlon. 10 L“"g'“e
10 “l\1oreover, l have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, the
widow of Malilon, to be my wife in order to raise up the name
of the deceased on his inheritance, so that the name of the
deceased may not be cut off from his brothers or from the 11‘L1h-sﬂrezor-Power
‘court of his birth-place; you are witnesses today." iE'§;;,C§<§{§'§§ilame'“
11 And all the people who were in the ‘court, and the
elders, said, “W/’e are witnesses. .\/lay the LORD make the wom-
an vvho is coming into your home “like Rachel and Leah,
both of whom built the house of Israel; and niav you achieve
Zwealth in Eplirathah and ‘become famous in Bethlehem. 391
