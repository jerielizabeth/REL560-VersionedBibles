THE REVELATION TO
y JOHN
1 The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him
to show to his servants what must soon take place; and
he made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,
2 who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony
of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw. 3 Blessed is he who
reads aloud the words of the prophecy, and blessed are
those who hear, and who keep what is written therein; for
the time is near.
4 John to the seven churches that are in Asia:
Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and
who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before
his throne, 5 and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the
ﬁrst-born of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth.
To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by
his blood " and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and
Father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.
Amen. ’Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every
eye will see him, every one who pierced him; and all tribes
of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen.
8 “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God,
who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.
9 I John, your brother, who share with you in Jesus the
tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance, was
on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God
and the testimony of Jesus. “I was in the Spirit on the
Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet
" saying, “Write what you see in a book and send it to the
seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Per'ga-

﻿Promises and Warnings REVELATION 3
and you are dead. 2 Awake, and strengthen what remains
and is on the point of death, for I have not found your works
perfect in the sight of my Cod. 3 Remember then what you
received and heard; keep that, and repent. If you will not
awake, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at
what hour I will come upon you. ‘ Yet you have still a few
names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments;
and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.
5He who conquers shall be clad thus in white garments,
and I will not blot his name out of the book of life; I will
confess his name before my Father and before his angels.
" He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to
the churches.’ _
7 “And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:
‘The words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key
of David, who opens and no one shall shut, who shuts and
no one opens.
8 MI know your works. Behold, I have set before you
an open door, which no one is able to shut; I know that
you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word
and have not denied my name. 9 Behold, I will make those
of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and
are not, but lie behold, I will make them come and bow
down before your feet, and learn that I have loved you.
“’ Because you have kept my word of patient; endurance,
I will keep you from the hour of trial which is coming on
the whole world, to try those who dwell upon the earth.
“ I am coming soon; hold fast what you have, so that no one
may seize your crown. '2 He who conquers, I will make him a
pillar in the temple of my God; never shall he go out of
it, and I will write on him the name of my God, and the
name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem which comes

﻿The Heavenly I/Vors/zip REVELATION 5
four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four
elders, clad in white garments, with golden crowns upon
their heads. 5From the throne issue flashes of lightning,
and voices and peals of thunder, and before the throne
burn seven torches of ﬁre, which are the seven spirits of
God; ° and before the throne there is as it were a sea of glass,
like crystal.
And round the throne, on each side of the throne, are
four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind: 7 the
ﬁrst living creature like a lion, the second living creature
like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man,
and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle. .8 And the
four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of
eyes all round and within, and day and night they never
cease to sing,
“Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,
who was and is and is to come!”
°And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor
and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, who lives
for ever and ever, '° the twenty-tour elders fall down before
him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives
for ever and ever; they cast their crowns before the throne,
singing,
“ “Worthy art thou, our Lord and God,
to receive glory and honor and power,
for thou didst create all things,
and by thy will they existed and were created.“
5 And I saw in the right hand of him who was seated
on the throne a scroll written within and on the back,
sealed with seven seals; Zand I saw a strong angel pro-
claiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the
9'?!“

and might for ever and ever!" “ And the four living crea-
tures said, “Amen! ” and the elders fell down and worshiped.
6 Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven
seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say,
as with a voice of thunder, “Come! " 2 And I saw, and behold,
a white horse, and its rider had a bow; and a crown was
given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.
3 When he opened the second seal, I heard the second
living creature say, “Come! ” " And out came another horse,
bright red; its rider was permitted to take peace from the
earth, so that men should slay one another; and he was given
a great sword.
5 When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living
creature say, “Come!” And I saw, and behold, a black
horse, and its rider had a balance'in his hand; ° and I heard
what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living
creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius,“ and
three quarts of barley for a denarius;° but do not harm oil
and wine! ”
7 When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of
the fourth living creature say, “Come!” B And I saw, and
behold, a pale horse, and its rider’s name was Death, and
Hades followed him; and they were given power over a
fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and
with pestilence and by wild beasts of the earth.
9 When he opened the ﬁlth seal, I saw under the altar
the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God
and for the witness they had borne; ‘° they cried out with
a loud voice, “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long
before thou wilt judge and avenge our blood on those who

thousand of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand of the tribe
of Naph'ta-li, twelve thousand of the tribe of l\/la-nas'seh,
7 twelve thousand of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand
of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand of the tribe of ls'sa-
char, 8 twelve thousand of the tribe of Zeb'u-lun, twelve
thousand of the tribe of _]oseph, twelve thousand sealed out
of the tribe of Benjamin.
9 After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude which
no man could number, from every nation, from all tribes
and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and
before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches
in their hands, “' and crying out with a loud voice, “Salva-
tion belongs to our God who sits upon the throne, and to
the Lamb!" '1 And all the angels stood round the throne
and round the elders and the tour living creatures, and they
fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
'2 saying, “Amen! Blessing and gloryand wisdom and thanks-
giving and honor and power and might be to our God for
ever and ever! Amen.”
13 Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who
are these, clothed in white robes, and whence have they
come?" “I said to him, “Sir, you know.” And he said to
me, “These are they who have come out of the great tribu-
lation; they have washed their robes and made them white
in the blood of the Lamb.
'5 Therefore are they before the throne of God,
and serve him day and night within his temple;
and he who sits upon the throne will shelter them
with his presence.
"’ They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more;
the sun shall not strike them, nor any scorching
heat.

﻿Opening the Bottomless Pit REVELATION 9
wormwood, and many men died of the water, because it was
made bitter.
12 The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of
the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third
of the stars, so that a third of their light was darkened;
a third of the day was kept from shining, and likewise a
third of the night.
13 Then I looked, and l heard an eagle crying with a loud
voice, as it flew in midheaven, “Woe, woe, woe to those
who dwell on the earth, at the blasts of the other trumpets
which the three angels are about to blow!”
9 And the ﬁlth angel blew his trumpet, and l saw a
star fallen from heaven to earth, and he was given the
key of the shalt of the bottomless pit; 2 he opened the shaft
of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft rose smoke like
the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were
darkened with the smoke from the shaft. 3 Then from the
smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given power
like the power of scorpions of the earth; 4 they were told
not to harm the grass of the earth or any green growth
or any tree, but only those of mankind who have not the
seal of God upon their foreheads; Sthey were allowed to
torture them for ﬁve months, but not to kill them, and their
torture was like the torture of a scorpion, when it stings
a man. " And in those days men will seek death and will not
ﬁnd it; they will long to die, and death flies from them.
7 ln appearance the locusts were like horses arrayed for
battle; on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold;
their faces were like human faces, S their hair like women’s
hair, and their teeth like lions’ teeth; 9 they had scales like
iron breastplates, and the noise of their wings was like the

﻿The Bitter Scroll REVELATION 11
Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from
10 heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over
his head, and his face was like the sun, and his legs like
pillars of ﬁre. 2 He had a little scroll open in his hand. And
he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land,
3 and called out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring; when
he called out, the seven thunders sounded. ‘And when
the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write,
but I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up what
the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.”
5 And the angel whom I saw standing on sea and land lifted
up his right hand to heaven 6 and swore by him who lives
for ever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it,
the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it,
that there should be no more delay, 7 but that in the days
of the trumpet call to be sounded by the seventh angel,
the mystery of God, as he announced to his servants the
prophets, should be fulﬁlled.
8 Then the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke
to me again, saying, “Go, take the scroll which is open
in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and
on the land.” 9 So I went to the angel and told him to give
me the little scroll; and he said to me, “Take it and eat;
it will be bitter to your stomach, but sweet as honey in
your mouth.” '° And I took the little scroll from the hand
of the angel and ate it; it was sweet as honey in my mouth,
but when I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter. “ And
I was told, “You must again prophesy about many peoples
and nations and tongues and kings.”
Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and
1 ]_ I was told: “Rise and measure the temple of God

a cloud. 1’ And at that hour there was a great earthquake,
and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were
killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terriﬁed and gave
glory to the God of heaven.
14 The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is
soon to come.
15 Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there
were loud voices in heaven, saying, “The kingdom of the
world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ,
and he shall reign for ever and ever.” “’ And the twenty-four
elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces
and worshiped God, ‘7 saying,
“We give thanks to thee, Lord Cod almighty, who
art and who wast,
‘ that thou hast taken thy great power and begun
to reign.
‘S The nations raged, but thy wrath came,
and the time for the dead to be judged,
for rewarding thy servants, the prophets and saints,
and those who fear thy name, both small and great,
and for destroying the destroyers of the earth."
19 Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and the ark
of his covenant was seen within his temple; and there were
flashes of lightning, loud noises, peals of thunder, an earth-
quake, and heavy hail.
1 2 And a great portent appeared in heaven, a woman
‘ clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet,
and on her head a crown of twelve stars; 2 she was with
child and she cried out in her pangs of birth, in anguish for
delivery. 3 And another portent appeared in heaven; behold

﻿The Beast from the Sea REVELATION 13
of the great eagle that she might ﬂy from the serpent into
the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished
for a time, and times, and half a time. ‘5 The serpent poured
water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to
sweep her away with the ﬂood. "’ But the earth came to the
help of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and
swallowed the river which the dragon had poured from his
mouth. ‘7 Then the dragon was angry with the woman,
and went off to make war on the rest of her ofispring, on
those who keep the commandments of God and bear testi-
mony to Jesus. And he stoode on the sand of the sea.
1 And l saw a beast rising out oi the sea, with ten
3 horns and seven heads, with ten diadems upon its
horns and a blasphemous name upon its heads. 2 And the
beast that I saw was like a leopard, its feet were like a bear's,
and its mouth was like a lion’s mouth. And to it the dragon
gave his power and his throne and great authority. 3 One oi
its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal
wound was healed, and the whole earth followed the beast with
wonder. ‘ Men worshiped the dragon, for he had given his
authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying,
“Who is like the beast, and who can ﬁght against it?”
5 And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty
and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise
authority for forty-two months; ° it opened its mouth to
utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and
his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven. ’Also it
f
was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them.
And authority was given it over every tribe and people
and tongue and nation, “and all who dwell on earth will
worship it, every one whose name has not been written
' Some ancient authorities read And I stood, connecting the sentence with 13. 1.

﻿I/ze New Song REVEI.A'1‘l()N 14
sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder;
the voice I heard was like the sound of harpcrs playing
on their harps, 3 and they sing a new song before the throne
and before the four living creatures and before the elders.
No one could learn that song except the hundred and forty-
four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth.
4 It is these who have not deﬁled themselves with women,
for they are chaste ;h it is these who follow the Lamb wherever
he goes; these. have been redeemed from mankind as ﬁrst
fruits for God and the Lamb, sand in their mouth no lie
was found, for they are spotless.
6 Then I saw another angel ﬂying in midheaven, with
an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth,
to every nation and tribe and tongue and people; 7 and he
said with a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, for
the hour of his judgment has come; and worship him who
made heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of water.”
8 Another angel, a second, followed, saying, “Fallen,
fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all nations drink
the wine of her impure passion.”
9 And another angel, a third, followed, saying with a
loud voice, “lf any one worships the beast and its image,
and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, ‘° he
also shall drink the wine of God's wrath, poured unmixed
into the cup of his anger, and he shall be tormented with
ﬁre and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and
in the presence of the Lamb. " And the smoke of their tor-
ment goes up for ever and ever: and they have no rest, day
or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and
whoever receives the mark of its name."
12 Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those
who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.

﻿The Seven Bowls of Wrath REVELATION 16
the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the
Lamb, saying,
“Great and wonderful are thy deeds,
0 Lord God the Almighty!
just and true are thy ways,
O King of the ages!’
4 Who shall not fear and glorify thy name, O Lord?
For thou alone art holy.
All nations shall come and worship thee,
for thy judgments have been revealed."
5 After this I looked, and the temple of the tent of witness
in heaven was opened, ° and out of the temple came the
seven angels with the seven plagues, robed in pure bright
linen, and their breasts girded with golden girdles. 7And
one of the tour living creatures gave the seven angels seven
golden bowls full of the wrath of Cod who lives for ever
and ever; 8 and the temple was ﬁlled with smoke from the
glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter
the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were
ended.
1  Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling
the seven angels, “Go and pour out on the earth
the seven bowls of the wrath of God.”
2 So the ﬁrst angel went and poured his bowl on the
earth, and foul and evil sores came upon the men who bore
the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.
3 The second angel poured his bowl into the sea, and it
became like the blood of a dead man, and every living thing
died that was in the sea.
4 The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and

﻿REVELATION 16 The Judgments of the Almighty
the fountains of water, and they became blood. 5And l
heard the angel of water say,
“just art thou in these thy judgments,
thou who art and wast, O Holy One.
° For men have shed the blood of saints and prophets,
and thou hast given them blood to drink.
lt is their due! ”
7 And l heard the altar cry,
“Yea, Lord God the Almighty,
true and just are thy judgments!”
8 The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun, and it
was allowed to scorch men with ﬁre; 9 men were scorched
by the ﬁerce heat, and they cursed the name of God who
had power over these plagues, and they did not repent and
give him glory.
10 The ﬁlth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the
beast, and its kingdom was in darkness; men gnawed their
tongues in anguish “ and cursed the God of heaven for their
pain and sores, and did not repent of their deeds.
12 The sixth angel poured his bowl on the great river
Eu-phra'tes, and its water was dried up, to prepare the
way for the kings from the east. '3 And l saw, issuing from
the mouth of the dragon and from the mouth of the beast
and from the mouth of the false prophet, three foul spirits
like frogs; “ for they are devil spirits, performing signs,
who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, to assemble
them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty.

﻿The Judgment of Babylon REVELATION 17
17 The seventh angel poured his bowl into the air, and
a great voice came out of the temple, from the throne, saying,
“lt is done!” ‘S And there were ﬂashes of lightning, loud
noises, peals of thunder, and a great earthquake such as
had never been since men were on the earth, so great was
that earthquake. 1° The great city was split into three parts,
and the cities of the nations fell, and Cod remembered
great Babylon, to make her drain the cup of the fury of his
wrath. 2° And every island ﬂed away, and no mountains were
to be found; 2' and great hailstones, heavy as a hundred-
weight, dropped on men from heaven, till men cursed God
for the plague of the hail, so tearful was that plague.
1 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven
7 bowls came and said to me, “Come, l will show you
the judgment of the great harlot who is seated upon many
waters, 2 with whom the kings of the earth have committed
fornication, and with the wine of whose fornication the
dwellers on earth have become drunk.” 3And he carried
me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and l saw a woman
sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of blasphemous
names, and it had seven heads and ten horns. 4 The woman
was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and bedecked with gold
and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup lull
of abominations and the impurities of her fornication; 5 and
on her forehead was written a name of mystery: “Babylon
the great, mother of harlots and of earth’s abominations.”
° And l saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints
and the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.
When l saw her l marveled greatly. 7 But the angel said

﻿The Doom of Babylon REVELATION 18
made bright with his splendor. 2 And he called out with a
mighty voice,
“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!
lt has become a dwelling place of demons,
a haunt of every foul spirit,
a haunt of every foul and hateful bird;
3 for all nations have drunkk the wine of her impure
passion,
and the kings of the earth have committed fornica-
tion with her,
and the merchants of the earth have grown rich
with the wealth of her wantonness.”
4 Then l heard another voice from heaven saying,
“Come out of her, my people,
lest you take part in her sins,
lest you share in her plagues;
5 for her sins are heaped high as heaven,
and God has remembered her iniquities.
6 Render to her as she herself has rendered,
and repay her double lor her deeds;
mix a double draught for her in the cup she mixed.
7 As she gloriﬁed herself and played the wanton,
so give her a like measure of torment and mourning.
Since in her heart she says, ‘A queen l sit,
l am no widow, mourning l shall never see,’
8 so shall her plagues come in a single day,
pestilence and mourning and famine,
and she shall be burned with ﬁre;
tor mighty is the Lord God who judges her.”
9 And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication
and were wanton with her, will weep and wail over her

﻿Silence in the Doomed City REVELATION 19
where all who had ships at sea grew rich by her
wealth!
In one hour she has been laid waste.
2° Rejoice over her, O heaven,
O saints and apostles and prophets,
for God has given judgment for you against her!”
21 Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great mill-
stone and threw it into the sea, saying,
“So shall Babylon the great city be thrown down with
violence,
and shall be found no more;
'2 and the sound of harpers and minstrels, of ﬂute
players and trumpeters,
shall be heard in thee no more;
and a craftsman of any craft
shall be found in thee no more;
and the sound of the millstone
shall be heard in thee no more;
23 and the light of a lamp
shall shine in thee no more;
and the voice of bridegroom and bride
shall be heard in thee no more;
for thy merchants were the great men of the earth,
and all nations were deceived by thy sorcery.
“ And in her was found the blood of prophets and of
saints,
and of all who have been slain on earth.”
1 9 After this l heard what seemed to be the mighty
voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying,
“Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to
our God,

﻿The Warrior F aithful and True REVELATION 20
11 Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse!
He who sat upon it is called Faithful and True, and in right-
eousness he judges and makes war. '2 His eyes are like a
ﬂame of ﬁre, and on his head are many diadems; and he
has a name inscribed which no one knows but himself. '3 He
is clad in a robe dipped inm blood, and the name by which
he is called is The Word of God. 1‘ And the armies of heaven,
arrayed in ﬁne linen, white and pure, followed him on white
horses. ‘5 From his mouth issues a sharp sword with which
to smite the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of
iron; he will tread the wine press of the ﬁiry of the wrath
of God the Almighty. “’ 0n his robe and on his thigh he
has a name inscribed, King of kings and Lord of lords.
17 Then l saw an angel standing in the sun, and with
a loud voice he called to all the birds that ﬂy in midheaven,
“Come, gather for the great supper of God, ‘S to eat the
flesh of kings, the ﬂesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men,
the ﬂesh of horses and their riders, ‘and the flesh of all men,
both free and slave, both small and great.” 1° And l saw
the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gath-
ered to make war against him who sits upon the horse
and against his army. 2° And the beast was captured, and
with it the false prophet who in its presence had worked
the signs by which he deceived those who had received the
mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These
two were thrown alive into the lake of ﬁre that burns with
brimstone. 2' And the rest were slain by the sword of him
who sits upon the horse, the sword that issues from his
mouth; and all the birds were gorged with their ﬂesh.
20 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven,
holding in his hand the key of the bottomless pit and

no place was found for them. '2 And I saw the dead, great
and small, standing before the throne, and books were
opened. Also another book was opened, which is the book
of life. And the dead were judged by what was written
in the books, by what they had done. “ And the sea gave
up the dead in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead in
them, and all were judged by what they had done. “ Then
Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of ﬁre. This is
the second death, the lake of ﬁre; '5 and if anyone’s name was
not Found written in the book of life, he was thrown into
the lake of ﬁre.
2 1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the
ﬁrst heaven and the ﬁrst earth had passed away,
and the sea was no more. ' And I saw the holy city, new
Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared
as a bride adorned for her husband; 3 and I heard a great
voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling of God
is with men. He will dwell with them, and they shall be his
people,° and God himself will be with them ;'° 4 he will wipe
away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more,
neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain any
more, for the former things have passed away.”
5 And he who sat upon the throne said, “Behold, I make
all things new.” Also he said, “Write this, for these words
are trustworthy and true.” ° And he said to me, “It is done!
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.
To the thirsty I will give water without price from the
fountain of the water of life. 7 He who conquers shall have
this heritage, and I will be his God and he shall be my son.

﻿For the Healing of the Nations REVELATION 22
the twelfth amethyst. 2' And the twelve gates were twelve
pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and the
street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass.
22 And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the
Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. 23 And the city has
no need of sun or moon to shine upon it, for the glory of
God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb. 2‘ By its light
shall the nations walk; and the kings of the earth shall bring
their glory into it, '5 and its gates shall never be shut by
day—— and there shall be no night there; 2° they shall bring
into it the glory and the honor of the nations. 27 But nothing
unclean shall enter it, nor any one who practices abomination
or falsehood, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s
book of life.
22 Then he showed me the river of the water of life,
bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and
of the Lamb 2 through the middle of the street of the city;'
also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve
kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves
of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 3 There shall
no more be anything accursecl, but the throne of God and
of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall worship
him; 4 they shall see his face, and his name shall be on their
foreheads. 5 And night shall be no more; they need no light
of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and
they shall reign for ever and ever.
6 And he said to me, “These words are trustworthy and
true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets,
has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take
place. 7 And behold, I am coming soon.”
’ Or the Lamb. In the midst of the street of the city, and on either side of the river, was the tree
0/life, etr-.
