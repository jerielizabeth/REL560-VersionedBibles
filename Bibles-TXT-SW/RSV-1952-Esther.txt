THE BOOK or
ESTHER
ln the days of Ahasu-e'rus, the Ahasu-e'rus who reigned
1 from India to Ethiopia over one hundred and twenty-
seven provinces, 2 in those days when King Ahasu-e'rus sat on
his royal throne in Susa the capital, sin the third year of his
reign he gave a banquet for all his princes and servants, the
army chiefs " of Persia and Media and the nobles and governors
of the provinces being before him, 4 while he showed the riches
of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his majesty for
many days, a hundred and eighty days. 5 And when these days
were completed, the king gave for all the people present in
susa the capital, both great and small, a banquet lasting for
seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.
'3 There were white cotton curtains and blue hangings caught up
with cords of ﬁne linen and purple to silver rings " and marble
pillars, and also couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pave-
ment of porphyry, marble, mother—of-pearl and precious
stones. 7 Drinks were served in golden goblets, goblets of differ-
ent kinds, and the royal wine was lavished according to the
bounty of the king. 8 And drinking was according to the law, no
one was compelled; for the king had given orders to all the
oﬁicials of his palace to do as every man desired. 9 Queen Vashti
also gave a banquet for the women in the palace which be-
longed to King Ahasu~e'rus.
10 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was
merry with wine, he commanded lVlehu'man, Biztha, l"larbo'na,
Bigtha and Abag'tha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs
who served King Ahasu—e'rus as chamberlains, H to bring Queen
Vashti before the king with her royal crown, in order to show
the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to be-

hold. “But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s com-
mand conveyed by the eunuchs. At this the king was enraged,
and his anger burned within him.
13 Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times
——for this was the king's procedure toward all who were versed
in law and judgment, “ the men next to him being Carshe'na,
Shethar, Adma'tha, Tarshish, lVleres, lVlarse'na, and l\/lemu'can,
the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face,
and sat ﬁrst in the kingdom—: 15 “According to the law, what
is to be done to Queen Vashti, because she has not performed
the command of King Ahasu-e'rus conveyed by the eunuchs .3”
1‘ Then lVlemu'can said in presence of the king and the princes,
“Not only to the king has Queen Vashti done wrong, but also to
all the princes and all the people who are in all the provinces of
King Ahasu-e'rus. “For this deed of the queen will be made
known to all women, causing them to look with contempt upon
their husbands, since they will say, ‘King Ahasu-e'rus com-
manded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, and she did
not come.’ 18 This very day the ladies of Persia and Media who
have heard of the queen’s behavior will be telling it to all the
king's princes, and there will be contempt and wrath in plenty.
19 If it please the king, let a royal order go forth from him, and
let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes
so that it may not be altered, that Vashti is to come no more be-
fore King Ahasu-e'rus; and let the king give her royal position
to another who is better than she. 2° So when the decree made
by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom, vast as
it is, all women will give honor to their husbands, high and
low.” 21 This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the
king did as lVlemu'can proposed; 22 he sent letters to all the
royal provinces, to every province in its own script and to every
people in its own language, that every man be lord in his own
house and speak according to the language of his people.

for the women, since this was the regular period of their beauti-
fying. six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices
and ointments for women—“ when the maiden went in to the
king in this way she was given whatever she desired to take
with her from the harem to the king’s palace. H In the evening
she went, and in the morning she came back to the second
harem in custody of Sha-ash'gaz the king's eunuch who was in
charge of the concubines; she did not go in to the king again,
unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by
name.
l F When the turn came for Esther the daughter of Ab'ihail
the uncle of lVlor'decai, who had adopted her as his own daugh-
ter, to go in to the king, she asked for nothing except what
Hegai the kingis eunuch, who had charge of the women, ad-
vised. Now Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her.
1" And when Esther was taken to King Ahasu-e'rus into his royal
palace in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the
seventh year of his reign, 17 the king loved Esther more than all
the women, and she found grace and favor in his sight more
than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head
and made her queen instead of Vashti. 18 Then the king gave a
great banquet to all his princes and servants; it was Esther's
banquet. He also granted a remission of taxes ‘A to the provinces,
and gave gifts with royal liberality.
19 When the virgins were gathered together the second
time, l\/lor'decai was sitting at the king’s gate. 2° Now Esther
had not made known her kindred or her people, as lVlor'decai
had charged her; for Esther obeyed lVlor'decai just as when she
was brought up by him. 2' And in those days, as Mor'decai was
sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's
eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, became angry and sought
to lay hands on King Ahasu-e'rus. 22 And this came to the
knowledge of lVlor'decai, and he told it to Queen Esther, and

Esther told the king in the name of lVlor'decai. 23 When the affair
was investigated and found to be so, the men were both hanged
on the gallows. And it was recorded in the Book of the Chroni-
cles in the presence of the king.
After these things King Ahasu—e'rus promoted Haman
3 the son of Hammeda'tha the Ag'agite, and advanced him
and set his seat above all the princes who were with him. 2/\nd
all the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down
and did obeisance to Haman; for the king had so commanded
concerning him. But lVlor'decai did not bow down or do obei—
sance. 'i’Then the king’s servants who were at the king's gate
said to l\/lor'decai, “Why do you transgress the king’s com-
mand?” ‘And when they spoke to him day after day and he
would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see
whether Mor'decai's words would avail; for he had told them
that he was a Jew. 5And when Haman saw that lVlor'decai did
not bow down or do obeisance to him, Haman was ﬁlled with
fury. " But he disdained to lay hands on l\/lor'decai alone. So,
as they had made known to him the people of lVlor'decai, Ha—
man sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of lVlor'decai,
throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasu—e'rus.
7 ln the ﬁrst month, which is the month of Nisan, in the
twelfth year of King Ahasu—e'rus, they cast Put, that is the lot,
before Haman day after day; and they cast it month after
month till the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.
8Then Haman said to King Ahasu~e'rus, “There is a certain
people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all
the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from
those of every other people, and they do not keep the king’s
laws, so that it is not for the king’s proﬁt to tolerate them. 9 If
it please the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and
l will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those
who have charge of the king’s business, that they may put it

into the king's treasuries.” “'50 the king took his signet ring
from his hand and gave it to Haman the /\g'agite, the son of
Hammeda'tha, the enemy of the Jews. H And the king said to
Haman, “The money is given to you, the people also, to do
with them as it seems good to you."
12 Then the king's secretaries were summoned on the thir-
teenth day of the ﬁrst month, and an edict, according to all that
Haman commanded, was written to the king’s satraps and to
the governors over all the provinces and to the princes of all
the peoples, to every province in its own script and every
people in its own language; it was written in the name of King
Ahasu—e’rus and sealed with the king's ring. '3 Letters were sent
by couriers to all the king's provinces, to destroy, to slay, and
to annihilate all jews, young and old, women and children, in
one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the
month of Adar, and to plunder their goods. “A copy of the
document was to be issued as a decree in every province by
proclamation to all the peoples to be ready for that day. '5 The
couriers went in haste by order of the king, and the decree was
issued in Susa the capital. And the king and l-laman sat down
to drink; but the city of Susa was perplexed.

When l\’lor decai learned all that had been done, Mot’-

went out into the midst of the city, wailing with a loud and
bitter cry; zhe went up to the entrance of the king’s gate, for
no one might enter the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth. 3 And
in every province, wherever the kings command and his decree
came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting
and weeping and lamenting. and most of them lay in sackcloth
and ashes.
4 When Esther’s maids and her eunuchs came and told her,
the queen was deeply distressed; she sent garments to clothe
lVlor'clecai, so that he might take oft his sackcloth, but he would

On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood
5 in the inner court of the king's palace, opposite the king's
hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne inside the palace
opposite the entrance to the palace; 2 and when the king saw
Queen Esther standing in the court, she found favor in his sight
and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his
hand. Then Esther approached and touched the top of the
scepter. 3And the king said to her, “What is it, Queen Esther?
What is your request? lt shall be given you, even to the half of
my kingdom.” ‘And Esther said, “lf it please the king, let the
king and Haman come this day to a dinner that l have prepared
for the king.” 5 Then said the king, “Bring Haman quickly, that
we may do as Esther desires.“ So the king and Haman came to
the dinner that Esther had prepared. " And as they were drink-
ing wine, the king said to Esther, “What is your petition? lt
shall be granted you. Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall
be fulfilled." 7 But Esther said, “lVly petition and my request is:
S If l have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please
the king to grant my petition and fulﬁl my request, let the king
and Haman come tomorrow '1 to the dinner which I will prepare
for them, and tomorrow l will do as the king has said.”
9 And Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart.
But when Haman saw lVlor'decai in the king’s gate, that he
neither rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath
against l\/lor'decai. 1° Nevertheless Haman restrained himself,
and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and his
wife Zeresh. “And Haman recounted to them the splendor of
his riches, the number of his sons, all the promotions with
which the king had honored him, and how he had advanced
him above the princes and the servants of the king. 12 And
Haman added, “Even Queen Esther let no one come with the
king to the banquet she prepared but myself. And tomorrow
also I am invited by her together with the king. U Yet all this

does me no good, so long as I see Mo/decai the Jew sitting at
the king’s gate.” N Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said
to him, “Let a gallows ﬁfty cubits high be made, and in the
morning tell the king to have lVlor'decai hanged upon it; then
go merrily with the king to the dinner.” This counsel pleased
Haman, and he had the gallows made.
6 On that night the king could not sleep; and he gave
orders to bring the book of memorable deeds, the chron-
icles, and they were read before the king. 2And it was found
written how lVlOl"Cl€C3.i had told about Bigthana and Teresh,
two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, and who
had sought to lay hands upon King Ahasu—e'rus. 3 And the king
said, “What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mo/decai
tor this .3” The king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing
has been clone for him.” ‘And the king said, “Who is in the
court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the
king’s palace to speak to the king about having Mor'decai
hanged on the gallows that he had prepared for him. 5 So the
king’s servants told him, “Haman is there, standing in the
court.” And the king said, “Let him come in.” 650 Harnan
came in, and the king said to him, “What shall be done to the
man whom the king delights to honor?” And Haman said to
himself, “Whom would the king delight to honor more than
me?” Tand Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the
king delights to honor, Blet royal robes be brought, which
the king has worn, and the horse which the king has ridden,
and on whose head a royal crown is set; gand let the robes
and the horse be handed over to one of the king’s most noble
princes; let him" array the man whom the king delights to
honor, and let him " conduct the man on horseback through the
open square of the city, proclaiming before him: ‘Thus shall
it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.’ "
1” Then the king said to Haman, “Make haste, take the robes

and the horse, as you have said, and do so to lVlor'decai the
Jew who sits at the king's gate. Leave out nothing that you
have mentioned.” ‘I So Haman took the robes and the horse,
and he arrayed lVlor'decai and made him ride through the open
square of the city, proclaiming, “Thus shall it be done to the
man whom the king delights to honor.”
12 Then lVlor'decai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman
hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered.
“And Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends every-
thing that had befallen him. Then his wise men and his wife
Zeresh said to him, “It lVlor'decai, before whom you have be-
gun to tall, is of the Jewish people, you will not prevail against
him but will surely tall before him.”
14 While they were yet talking with him, the king’s eunuchs
arrived and brought Haman in haste to the banquet that Esther
had prepared.
So the king and Harnan went in to feast with Queen
7 Esther. 2And on the second day, as they were drinking
wine, the king again said to Esther, “What is your petition,
Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your re-
quest? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulﬁlled.”
3 Then Queen Esther answered, “lf l have found favor in your
sight, O king, and it it please the king, let my lite be given me
at my petition, and my people at my request. 4 For we are sold,
I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to be anni-
hilated. lf we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women,
l would have held my peace; for our aﬁliction is not to be com-
pared with the loss to the king.” 5Then King Ahasu—e'rus said
to Queen Esther, “Wlio is he, and where is he, that would
presume to do this?” “And Esther said, “A foe and enemy!
This wicked Hamanl ” Then l-laman was in terror before the
king and the queen. 7 And the king rose from the feast in wrath
and went into the palace garden; but Haman stayed to beg his

w'ould lay hands on the Jews. 8 And you may write as you please
with regard to the Jews, in the name of the king, and seal it
with the king’s ring; for an edict written in the name of the
king and sealed with the ltingis ring cannot be revoked.”
9 The kingis secretaries were summoned at that time, in the
third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third
day; and an edict was written according to all that Mor'decai
commanded concerning the Jews to the satraps and the gover-
nors and the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, a
hundred and twenty-seven provinces, to every province in its
own script and to every people in its own language, and also
to the Jews in their script and their language. 1° The writing
was in the name of King Ahasu-e'rus and sealed with the l<ing’s
ring, and letters were sent by mounted couriers riding on swift
horses that were used in the king's service, bred from the royal
stud. '1 By these the king allowed the Jews who were in every
city to gather and defend their lives, to destroy, to slay, and to
annihilate any armed force of any people or province that
might attack them, with their children and women, and to
plunder their goods, 12 upon one clay throughout all the prov-
inces of King Ahasu-e'rus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth
month, which is the month of Adar. ‘3 A copy of what was writ-
ten was to be issued as a decree in every province, and by
proclamation to all peoples, and the Jews were to be ready on
that day to avenge themselves upon their enemies. “So the
couriers, mounted on their swift horses that were used in the
king’s service, rode out in haste, urged by the king’s command;
and the decree was issued in Susa the capital.
15 Then lVlor'decai went out from the presence of the king
in royal robes of blue and white, with a great golden crown
and a mantle of ﬁne linen and purple, while the city of Susa
shouted and rejoiced. “The Jews had light and gladness and
joy and honor. “And in every province and in every city,
wherever the l<ing’s command and his edict came, there was

hanged on the gallows.” 1‘ so the king commanded this to be
done; a decree was issued in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman
were hanged. “The Jews who were in Susa gathered also on
the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they slew three
hundred men in Susa; but they laid no hands on the plunder.
l(i Now the other Jews who were in the l<ing’s provinces also
gathered to defend their lives, and got relief from their ene-
mies, and slew seventy-ﬁve thousand of those who hated them;
but they laid no hands on the plunder. “This was on the thir-
teenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day
they rested and made that a clay of feasting and gladness. 1“ But
the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth day and
on the fourteenth, and rested on the ﬁfteenth day, making that
a day of feasting and gladness. *9 Therefore the Jews of the vil-
lages, who live in the open towns, hold the fourteenth day of
the month of Adar as a day for glaclness and feasting and holi-
day-making, and a day on which they send choice portions to
one another.
Z0 And lVlor'decai recorded these things, and sent letters to
all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasu-e'rus,
both near and far, 2‘ enjoining them that they should keep the
fourteenth day of the month Adar and also the fifteenth day of
the same, year by year, 22 as the days on which the Jews got re-
lief from their enemies, and as the month that had been turned
for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a
holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and glad-
ness, days for sending choice portions to one another and gifts
to the poor.
23 So the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as
lVlor'decai had written to them. 2' For Haman the Ag'agite, the
son of Hammeda'tha, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted
against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the
lot, to crush and destroy them; 25 but when Esther came before
the king, he gave orders in writing that his wicked plot which
