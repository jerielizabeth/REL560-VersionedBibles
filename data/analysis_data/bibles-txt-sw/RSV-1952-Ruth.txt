﻿RFTH 1 Naomi and Ruth Return to J uda/z
she set out from the place where she was, with her two daugh-
ters-in-law, and they went on the way to return to the land of
Judah. 8But Na'omi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go,
return each of you to her mother’s house. l\/lay the LORD deal
kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.
9 The LORD grant that you may find a home, each of you in the
house of her husband! ” Then she kissed them, and they lifted
up their voices and wept. 1°./\nd they said to her, “No, we will
return with you to your people.” “But Na'omi said, “Turn
back, my daughters, why will you go with me? l-lave I yet sons
in my womb that they may become your husbands? 12 Turn
back, my daughters, go your way, for l am too old to have a
husband. If I should say I have hope, even if I should have a
husband this night and should bear sons, 13 would you therefore
wait till they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from
marrying? No, my daughters, for it is exceedingly bitter to me
for your sake that the hand of the LORD has gone forth against
me.” “Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and
Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.
15 And she said, “See, your sister-in-law has gone back to
her people and to her gods; return after your sister—in—law."
16 But Ruth said, “Entreat me not to leave you or to return
from following you; for where you go I will go, and where you
lodge I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your
God my God; "where you die I will die, and there will I be
buried. lVlay the LORD do so to me and more also if even death
parts me from you.” 18 And when l\la'omi saw that she was
determined to go with her, she said no more.
19 So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem.
And when they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred
because of them; and the women said, “ls this Na'omi .3” 2° She
said to them, “Do not call me l\la'omi,“ call me Mara,” for the

﻿RUTH 2 Boaz Deals Kindly with Her
found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me,
when l am a foreigner?” U But Bo'az answered her, “All that
you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your
husband has been fully told me, and how you left your father
and mother and your native land and came to a people that you
did not know before. 12 The LORD recompense you for what
you have done, and a full reward be given you by the LORD, the
God of lsrael, under whose wings you have come to take
refuge!” 13 Then she said, “You are most gracious to me, my
lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your
maidservant, though l am not one of your maidservants."
14 And at mealtime Bo'az said to her, “Come here, and eat
some bread, and dip your morsel in the wine.” So she sat beside
the reapers, and he passed to her parched grain; and she ate
until she was satisﬁed, and she had some left over. 15 When she
rose to glean, Bo'az instructed his young men, saying, “Let her
glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her. 1° And
also pull out some from the bundles for her, and leave it for her
to glean, and do not rebuke her.”
17 So she gleaned in the field until evening; then she beat
out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
18 And she took it up and went into the city; she showed her
mother-in-law what she had gleaned, and she also brought out
and gave her what food she had left over after being satisﬁed.
19 And her mother—in~law said to her, “Where did you glean to-
day? And where have you worked? Blessed be the man who
took notice of you.” So she told her mother—in~law with whom
she had worked, and said, “The man’s name with whom I
worked today is Bo'az." 2° And Na'omi said to her daughter-in-
law, “Blessed be he by the LORD, whose kindness has not for-
saken the living or the dead! ” Na'omi also said to her, “The
man is a relative of ours, one of our nearest kin.” 21And Ruth
the l\/loabitess said, “Besides, he said to me, ‘You shall keep

part of the next of kin tor you, then, as the LORD lives, I will do
the part of the next of kin for you. Lie clown until the morning.”
14 So she lay at his feet until the morning, but arose before
one could recognize another; and he said, “Let it not be known
that the woman came to the threshing ﬂoor.” “And he said,
“Bring the mantle you are wearing and hold it out.” So she held
it, and he measured out six measures of barley, and laid it upon
her; then she went into the city. “And when she came to her
mother-in—law, she said, “How did you fare, my daughter?"
Then she told her all that the man had done for her, 17 saying,
“These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said, ‘You
must not go back empty—handed to your mother—in-law.’ ”
18 She replied, “Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the
matter turns out, for the man will not rest, but will settle the
matter today.”
And Bo'az went up to the gate and sat down there; and
4- behold, the next of kin, of whom Bo'az had spoken, came
by. So Bo'az said, “Turn aside, friend; sit down here”; and he
turned aside and sat down. 2 And he tool< ten men of the elders
of the city, and said, “Sit down here”; so they sat clown. 3 Then
he said to the next of kin, “Na'omi, who has come back from
the country of ll/loab, is selling the parcel of land which be-
longed to our kinsman Elim'elech. 450 I thought l would tell
you of it, and say, Buy it in the presence of those sitting here,
and in the presence of the elders of my people. lf you will re-
deem it, redeem it; but if you will not, tell me, that l may know,
tor there is no one besides you to redeem it, and l come after
you.” And he said, “I will redeem it." 5Then Bo'az said, “The
day you buy the ﬁeld from the hand of Na'omi, you are also
buying Ruth ” the l\/loabitess, the widow of the dead, in order to
restore the name of the dead to his inheritance.” 6 Then the next

They named him Obed; he was the father of Jesse, the father

1 There was a certain man of Ramatha'im-z0'phim of the
hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elka'nah the
son of ]ero'ham, son of Eli'hu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an
E'phraimite. 2He had two wives; the name of the one was
Hannah, and the name of the other Penin'nah. And Penin'nah
had children, but Hannah had no children.
3 Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to
Worship and to sacriﬁce to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh, where
the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phin'ehas, were priests of the
LORD. 4On the day when Ell<a'nah sacriﬁced, he would give
portions to Penin'nah his wife and to all her sons and daugh-
ters; 5 and, although " he loved Hannah, he would give Hannah
only one portion, because the LORD had closed her womb. 6 And
her rival used to provoke her sorely, to irritate her, because the
LORD had closed her womb. 7 So it went on year by year; as
often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to pro-
voke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat. 8And
Ell<a'nah, her husband, said to her, “Hannah, why do you
weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad?
Am I not more to you than ten sons?”
