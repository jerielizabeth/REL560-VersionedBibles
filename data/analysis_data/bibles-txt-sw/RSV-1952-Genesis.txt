‘And Cod saw that the light was good; and God separated

the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there

F» And God said, “Let there he a ﬁrmament in the midst of

7 And God made the ﬁrmament and separated the waters which
were under the ﬁrmament from the waters which were above
the hrmament. And it was so. XAnd God called the ﬁrrnament
Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a

l—l And God said, “Let there be lights in the ﬁrmament of
the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them
be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, 15 and let
them be lights in the ﬁrmament oi the heavens to give light
upon the earth.” And it was so. 1“ And God made the two great
lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to
rule the night; he made the stars also. 17 And God set them in
the ﬁrmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth, 18 to
rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light
from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. wAnd there
was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
20 And God said, “Let the waters bring forth swarms of
living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the
ﬁrmament of the heavens.” “So God created the great sea
monsters and every living creature that moves, with which
the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged
bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 And
God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and ﬁll
the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”
2° And there was evening and there was morning, a ﬁfth day.
24 And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures
according to their kinds: cattle and creeping things and beasts
of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so. “And
God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and
the cattle according to their kinds, and everything that creeps
upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it
was good.

our likeness; and let them have dominion over the ﬁsh of the
sea, and over the birds oi the air, and over the cattle, and

l And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and
there he put the man whom he had formed. 9And out of the
ground the LORD God made to grow every tree that is pleasant
to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst
of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
10 A river ﬂowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there
it divided and became four rivers. “The name of the ﬁrst is
Pishon; it is the one which llows around the whole land of
Hav'ilah, where there is gold; 12 and the gold of that land is
good; bdellium and onyx stone are there. 13 The name of the
second river is Gihon; it is the one which ﬂows around the
whole land of Cush. H And the name of the third river is Hid'de-
kel, which ﬂows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the
Eu—phra'tes.
15 The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden
of Eden to till it and keep it. 1° And the LORD God commanded
the man, saying, “You may freely eat of every tree of the
garden; “but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die. “
l3 Then the LORD God said, “It is not good that the man
should be alone; I will make him a helper ﬁt for him.” W So out
ol the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the ﬁeld
and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see
what he would call them; and whatever the man called every
living creature, that was its name. 2° The man gave names to all
cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the
ﬁeld; but for the man there was not found a helper ﬁt for him.
:1 So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man,
and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place
with ﬂesh; 22 and the rib which the LORD God had taken from
the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.

“Where is Abel your brother?" He said, “I do not know; am I
my brother’s keeper .3" '0 And the LORD said, “What have you
done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from
the ground. H And now you are cursed from the ground, which
has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your
hand. 1: When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield to you
its strength; you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the
earth." 13 Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is greater
than l can bear. 14 Behold, thou hast driven me this day away
from the ground; and from thy face I shall be hidden; and l
shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever
ﬁnds me will slay me.” 15 Then the LORD said to him, “Not so! '
It any one slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-
fold.” And the LORD put a mark on Cain, lest any who came
upon him should kill him. “Then Cain went away from the
presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod.’ east of
Eden.
17 Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch;
and he built a city, and called the name of the city after the
name of his son, Enoch. “T0 Enoch was born lrad; and lrad
was the father of Me~hu'ja-el, and lVle—hu’ja-cl the father oi
Me-thu’sha-el, and lVle—thu'sha—el the lather of Lameeh. ”And
Lainech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and
the name of the other Zillah. 2” Adah bore Jabal; he was the
father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle. 2‘ His
brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who
play the lyre and pipe. 22 Zillah bore Tubal-cain; he was the
lorger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister oi
Tubal—cain was Na'ainah.

17 When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a
smoking ﬁre pot and a flaming torch passed between these
pieces. ls On that day the l.OR‘|J made a covenant with Abram,
saying, “To your descendants l give this land, from the river of
Egypt to the great river, the river Eu—phra'tes, W the land of the

]_ 6 had an Egyptian maid whose name was l-lagar; 2 and
Sar'ai said to Abram, “Behold now, the LORD has prevented me
from bearing children; go in to my maid; it may be that l shall
obtain children by her.” And Abram hearkened to the voice of
Sar"ai. RS0, alter Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of
Canaan, Sar'ai, Abramls wile, took Hagar the Egyptian her
maid, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wile. *4 And he
went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that
she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress.
5And Sar'ai said to Abram, “ll/lay the wrong done to me be on
you! l gave my maid to your embrace, and when she saw that
she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the
LORD judge between you and me l ” (' But Abram said to Sa/ai,
“Behold, your maid is in your power; do to her as you please.”
Then Sat/ai dealt harshly with her, and she lled from her.

the herd, and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the
servant, who hastened to prepare it. H Then he took curds, and
milk, and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before
them; and he stood by them under the tree while they ate.
9 They said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” And he
said, “She is in the tent.” 1° He said, “I will surely return to you
in the spring, and Sarah your wife shall have a son.” And Sarah
was listening at the tent door behind him. U Now Abraham and
Sarah were old, advanced in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah
after the manner of women. 12 So Sarah laughed to herself, say-
ing, “After I have grown old, and my husband is old, shall l
have pleasure .3” 13 The LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah
laugh, and say, ‘Shall l indeed bear a child, now that l am old?’
H ls anything too hard " for the LORD? At the appointed time I
will return to you, in the spring, and Sarah shall have a son.”
“But Sarah denied, saying, “I did not laugh"; for she was
afraid. He said, “No, but you did laugh."
10 Then the men set out from there, and they looked toward
Sodom; and Abraham went with them to set them on their
way. 17 The LORD said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what l am
about to do, 18 seeing that Abraham shall become a great and
mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall bless them-
selves by him? ‘Z 19 No, for I have chosen " him, that he may
charge his children and his household alter him to keep the way
of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice; so that the
LORD may bring to Abraham what he has promised him.”
2°Then the LORD said, “Because the outcry against sodom and
Como/rah is great and their sin is very grave, 21 l will go down
to see whether they have done altogether according to the out-
cry which has come to me; and if not, I will know.”
Z2 so the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom;

and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and
they ate. 4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, the
men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last
man, surrounded the house; Sand they called to Lot, “Where
are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us,
that we may know them." 6LOt went out of the door to the
men, shut the door after him, 7 and said, “I beg you, my broth-
ers, do not act so wickedly. 8 Behold, I have two daughters who
have not known man; let me bring them out to you, and do to
them as you please; only do nothing to these men, for they
have come under the shelter of my roof.” 9 But they said,
“Stand back! ” And they said, “This fellow came to sojourn,
and he would play the judge l Now we will deal worse with you
than with them.” Then they pressed hard against the man Lot,
and drew near to break the door. 1° But the men put forth their
hands and brought l_.ot into the house to them, and shut the
door. 11 And they struck with blindness the men who were at
the door of the house, both small and great, so that they wea-
ried themselves groping for the door.
12 Then the men said to Lot, “Have you any one else here?
Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or any one you have in the city,
bring them out of the place; U for we are about to destroy this
place, because the outcry against its people has become great
before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.” H So
Lot went out and said to his sons-in—law, who were to marry his
daughters, “Up, get out of this place; for the LORD is about to
destroy the city.” But he seemed to his sons—in—law to be jest~
ing.
15 When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying,
“Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are here,
lest you be consumed in the punishment of the city." 1° But he

dwelt in a cave with his two daughters. “And the first-horn
said to the younger, “Qur father is old, and there is not a man
on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.
32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with
him, that we may preserve offspring through our father.” 33 So
they made their father drink wine that night; and the f1rst—born
went in, and lay with her father; he did not know when she lay
down or when she arose. “And on the next day, the f1rst—born
said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father;
let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and
lie with him, that we may preserve offspring through our
father.” 35 So they made their father drink wine that night also;
and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he did not know
when she lay down or when she arose. 36 Thus both the daugh—
ters of Lot were with child by their father. 3‘_The ﬁrst-horn
bore a son, and called his name Moat); he is the father of the
Moabites to this day. 3“ The younger also bore a son, and called
his name Bemammi; he is the father of the Ammonites to this
day.
From there Abraham journeyed toward the terri-
2 Q tory of the Negeb, and dwelt between Kadesh and
Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. 3 And Abraham said of Sarah
his wife, “fihe is my sister.” And Ahim'elech king of Gerar sent
and took Sarah. 3But God came to Ahim'elech in a dream by
night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man, because
of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a inan’s wife.”
4 Now Ahim’elech had not approached her; so he said, “Lord,
wilt thou slay an innocent people? 5[)id he not himself say to
me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’
In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I
have done this." “Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I
know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart,

his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac.
‘And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight
days old, as God had commanded him. SAbraham was a hun-
dred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. " And Sarah
said, “God has made laughter for me; every one who hears will
laugh over me.” 7And she said, “Who would have said to
Abraham that Sarah would suckle children? Yet l have borne
him a son in his old age.”
8 And the child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made
a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. " But Sarah saw
the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abra-
ham, playing with her son Isaac." 1°30 she said to Abraham,
“Cast out this slave woman with her son; for the son of this
slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.” H And the
thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son.
‘Z But God said to Abraham, “Be not displeased because of the
lad and because of your slave woman; whatever Sarah says to
you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your descend-
ants be named. L3 And I will make a nation of the son of the
slave woman also, because he is your offspring." H So Abraham
rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water,
and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with
the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered
in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
15 When the water in the skin was gone, she cast the child
under one of the bushes. “Then she went, and sat down over
against him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot;
for she said, “Let me not look upon the death of the child.”
And as she sat over against him, the child lifted up his voicei
and wept. 17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel

After these things God tested Abraham, and said to
2 2 him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here am I.” 2He
said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and
go to the land of lVlori'ah, and offer him there as a burnt offer-
ing upon one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.” 350
Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his ass, and tool<
two of his young men with him, and his son EYBEXQC; and he cut
the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the
place of which God had told him. l On the third day Abraham
lifted up his eyes a.nd saw the place afar off. Svllhen Abraham
said to his young men, “Stay here with the ass; I and the lad
will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.” " And
Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it on
lsaac his son; and he took in his hand the ﬁre and the knife. so
they went both of them together. 7 And lsaac said to his father
Abraham, “l\’ly father! ” And he said, “Here am I, my son.“
He said, “Behold, the ﬁre and the wood; but where is the lamb
for a burnt offering?” S Abraham said, “God will provide him-
self the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they went both
of them together.
9 When they came to the place of which God had told him,
Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and
hound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
Wlihen Abraham put forth his hand, and took the knife to slay
his son. H But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven,
and said, “Abraham, Abraham l ” And he said, “Here am l.”
“He said, “Do not lay your hand on the lad or do anything to
him; for now I know that you fear Cod, seeing you have not
withheld your son, your only son, from me." 13 And Abraham
lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a
ram, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and
took the ram, and oflered it up as a burnt offering instead of
