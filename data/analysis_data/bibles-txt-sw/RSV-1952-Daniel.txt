THE BOOK or
DANIEL
In the third year of the reign of ]ehoi'akim king of
1 Judah, Nel:>uchadnez'zar king of Babylon came to Jeru-
salem and besieged it. 2 And the Lord gave ]ehoi'akim king of
Judah into his hand, with some of the vessels of the house of
God; and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of
his god, and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god. 3 Then
the king commanded Ash'penaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some
of the people of Israel, both of the royal family and of the
nobility, ‘youths without blemish, handsome and skilful in all
wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding learning,
and competent to serve in the king’s palace, and to teach them
the letters and language of the Chalde'ans. 5 The king assigned
them a daily portion of the rich food which the king ate, and of
the wine which he drank. They were to be educated for three
years, and at the end of that time they were to stand before the
king. 6 Among these were Daniel, Hanani'ah, lVIish'a-el, and
Azari'ah of the tribe of Judah. 7And the chief of the eunuchs
gave them names : Daniel he called Belteshaz'zar, I'Ianani'ah he
called Shadrach, lVlish'a-el he called l\/leshach, and Azari'ah he
called Abed'nego.
8 But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with
the king’s rich food, or with the wine which he drank; there-
fore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to deﬁle
himself. 9And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the
sight of the chief of the eunuchs ; 1° and the chief of the eunuchs

spirit is troubled to know the dream.” 4Then the Chalde'ans
said to the king,” “O king, live for ever! Tell your servants the
dream, and we will show the interpretation." 5The king an-
swered the Chalde'ans, “The word from me is sure: if you do
not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you
shall be torn limb from limb, and your houses shall be laid in
ruins. “But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you
shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. There-
fore show me the dream and its interpretation." 7 They an-
swered a second time, “Let the king tell his servants the dream,
and we will show its interpretation.” 8The king answered, “l
know with certainty that you are trying to gain time, because
you see that the word from me is sure 9 that if you do not make
the dream known to me, there is but one sentence for you. You
have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the
times change. Therefore tell me the dream, and l shall know
that you can show me its interpretation." 1° The Chalde'ans
answered the king, “There is not a man on earth who can meet
the king's demand; for no great and powerful king has asked
such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chalde'an. H The
thing that the king asks is difficult, and none can show it to the
king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with ﬂesh.”
12 Because of this the king was angry and very furious, and
commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.
13 So the decree went forth that the wisetmen were to be slain,
and they sought Daniel and his companions, to slay them.
1" Then Daniel replied with prudence and discretion to Ar'i-och,
the captain of the king's guard, who had gone out to slay the
wise men of Babylon; 15 he said to A/i-och, the king's captain,
“Why is the decree of the king so severe ?” Then Ar'i-och made
the matter known to Daniel. 1" And Daniel went in and besought

﻿Daniel Interprets the 1)/ream DANIEL 2
seen and its interpretation P” 27 Daniel answered the king, “No
wise men, enchanters, magicians, or astrologers can show to
the king the mystery which the king has asked, 28 but there is a.
God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known
to King Nebuchadnez'zar what will be in the latter days. Your
dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these :
29 To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what
would be hereafter, and he who reveals mysteries made known
to you what is to be. 3° But as for me, not because of any wis-
dom that I have more than all the living has this mystery been
revealed to me, but in order that the interpretation may be
made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts
of your mind.
31 “You saw, O king, and behold, a great image. This image,
mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its
appearance was frightening. “The head of this image was of
ﬁne gold, its breast and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of
bronze, 33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of
clay. M As you looked, a stone was cut out by no human hand,
and it smote the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke
them in pieces; 35 then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver,
and the gold, all together were broken in pieces, and became
like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind car-
ried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found.
But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain
and ﬁlled the whole earth.
36 “This was the dream; now we will tell the king its in-
terpretation. 37 You, 0 king, the king of kings, to whom the Cod
of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the might,
and the glory, 38 and into whose hand he has given, wherever
they dwell, the sons of men, the beasts of the ﬁeld, and the birds
of the air, making you rule over them all—you are the head of

King Nebuchadnez'zar made an image of gold, whose
3 height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits. He set
it up on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. 2Then
King Nebuchadnez'zar sent to assemble the satraps, the pre-
fects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the
justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces
to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchad-
nez'zar had set up. 3Then the satraps, the prefects, and the
governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the mag-
istrates, and all the officials of the provinces, were assembled
for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnez'zar had
set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnez'zar
had set up. 4 And the herald proclaimed aloud, “You are com-
manded, O peoples, nations, and languages, Sthat when you
hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe,
and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the
golden image that King Nebuchadnez'zar has set up; 6and
whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be
cast into a burning ﬁery furnace.” 7 Therefore, as soon as all the
peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp,
bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the peoples, nations, and
languages fell down and worshiped the golden image which
King Nebuchadnez'zar had set up.
S Therefore at that time certain Chalcle'ans came forward
and maliciously accused the Jews. 9They said to King Nebu-
chadnez'zar, “O king, live for ever! 1° You, Q king, have made
a decree, that every man who hears the sound of the horn,
pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, shall
fall down and worship the golden image; 11 and whoever does
not fall down and worship shall be cast into a burning fiery
furnace. 12 There are certain Jews whom you have appointed
over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Me-

﻿Deliverance from the Fiery Furnace DANIEL 4
Shaclrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego. 23 And these three men,
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego, fell bound into the burn—
ing ﬁery furnace.
24 Then King Nebuchadnez'zar was astonished and rose up
in haste. He said to his counselors, “Did we not cast three men
bound into the ﬁre?” They answered the king, “True, O king."
25 He answered, “But I see four men loose, walking in the midst
of the ﬁre, and they are not hurt; and the appearance of the
fourth is like a son of the gods.”
26 Then Nebuchadnez'zar came near to the door of the
burning ﬁery furnace and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed'nego, servants of the Most High God, come forth, and
come here l " Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'neg0 came
out from the ﬁre. 27And the satraps, the governors, and the
king's counselors gathered together and saw that the ﬁre had
not had any power over the bodies of those men; the hair of
their heads was not singed, their mantles '1 were not harmed,
and no smell of ﬁre had come upon them. 28 Nebuchadneizar
said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'-
nego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who
trusted in him, and set at nought the kingis command, and
yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god
except their own (lod. 29 Therefore I make a decree: Any peo-
ple, nation, or language that speaks anything against the Cod
of Shadrach, Meshach, and Al:>ed'nego shall be torn limb from
limb, and their houses laid in ruins; for there is no other god
who is able to deliver in this way.” ‘wlhen the king promoted
Shadrach, l\/leshach, and Abed'nego in the province of Babylon.
F King Nebuchadneizar to all peoples, nations, and lan»
4' guages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to
you! 2 lt has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders
that the Most High God has wrought toward me.

with the dew of heaven; let his lot be with the beasts in the
grass of the earth; 1“ let his mind be changed from a man’s,
and let a beastis mind be given to him; and let seven times pass
over him. "The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, the
decision by the word of the holy ones, to the end that the living
may know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men, and
gives it to whom he will, and sets over it the lowliest of men.’
1“ This dream l, King Nebuchadnez'zar, saw. And you, O Belte-
shaz'zar, declare the interpretation, because all the wise men
of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpre-
tation, but you are able, for the spirit of the holy godsl is in
you."
19 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshaz'zar, was dis-
mayed for a long time, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king
said, “Belteshaz'zar, let not the dream or the interpretation
alarm you.” Belteshaz'zar answered, "My lord, may the dream
be for those who hate you and its interpretation for your ene-
mies! 2" The tree you saw, which grew and became strong, so
that its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of
the whole earth; 21 whose leaves were fair and its fruit abun-
dant, and in which was food for all; under which beasts of the
ﬁeld found shade, and in whose branches the birds of the air
dwelt—22 it is you, 0 king, who have grown and become strong.
Your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your do-
minion to the ends of the earth. 23 And whereas the king saw a
watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying,
'Hew down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its
roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the
tender grass of the ﬁeld; and let him be wet with the dew of
heaven; and let his lot be with the beasts of the ﬁeld, till seven
times pass over him’ ; 2‘ this is the interpretation, O king: It is a

for his dominion is an everlasting dominion,
and his kingdom endures from generation to genera-
tion;
35 all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing;
and he does according to his will in the host of heaven
and among the inhabitants of the earth;
and none can stay his hand
or say to him, “What doest thou?"
36 At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the
glory of my kingdom, my majesty and splendor returned to
me. My counselors and my lords sought me, and I was estab-
lished in my kingdom, and still more greatness was added to
me. 37 Now I, Nebuchadnez'zar, praise and extol and honor the
King of heaven; for all his works are right and his ways are
just; and those who walk in pride he is able to abase.
King Belshaz'zar made a great feast for a thousand of
5 his lords, and drank wine in front of the thousand.
Z Belshaz'zar, when he tasted the wine, commanded that
the vessels of gold and of silver which Nebuchadnez'zar his
father had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem be brought,
that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might
drink from them. 3 Then they brought in the golden and silver
vessels j which had been taken out of the temple, the house of
God in Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives, and
his concubines drank from them. ‘They drank wine, and
praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, an?
stone.

sians, which cannot be revoked. 9 Therefore King Darius
signed the document and interdict.
10 When Daniel knew that the document had been signed,
he went to his house where he had windows in his upper cham-
ber open toward Jerusalem; and he got down upon his knees
three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God,
as he had done previously. U Then these men came by agree-
ment '” and found Daniel making petition and supplication be-
fore his God. 12 Then they came near and said before the king,
concerning the interdict, “O king! Did you not sign an inter-
dict, that any man who makes petition to any god or man within
thirty days except to you, 0 king, shall be cast into the den of
lions?” The king answered, “The thing stands fast, according
to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be re-
voked.” 13 Then they answered before the king, “That Daniel,
who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no heed to you, O
king, or the interdict you have signed, but makes his petition
three times a day.”
14 Then the king, when he heard these words, was much
distressed, and set his mind to deliver Daniel; and he labored
till the sun went down to rescue him. “Then these men came
by agreement '" to the king, and said to the king, “Know, O
king, that it is a law of the l\/ledes and Persians that no interdict
or ordinance which the king establishes can be changed.”
16 Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and
cast into the den of lions. The king said to Daniel, “May your
God, whom you serve continually, deliver you! " 17 And a stone
was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den, and the king
sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords,
that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel. 18 Then the
king went to his palace, and spent the night fasting; no diver-
sions were brought to him, and sleep fled from him.

﻿Daniel’s Dream of Four Beasts DANIEL 7
rible, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze; and which de-
voured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its
feet; 2° and concerning the ten horns that were on its head,
and the other horn which came up and before which three of
them fell, the horn which had eyes and a mouth that spoke
great things, and which seemed greater than its fellows. 2‘ As I
looked, this horn made war with the saints, and prevailed over
them, 22 until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was
given for the saints of the l\/lost High, and the time came when
the saints received the kingdom.
23 “Thus he said: ‘As for the fourth beast,
there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth,
which shall be different from all the kingdoms,
and it shall devour the whole earth,
and trample it down, and break it to pieces.
24 As for the ten horns,
out of this kingdom
ten kings shall arise,
and another shall arise after them;
he shall be different from the former ones,
and shall put down three kings.
‘S He shall speak words against the Most High,
and shall wear out the saints of the Most High,
and shall think to change the times and the law;
and they shall be given into his hand
for a time, two times, and half a time.
26 But the court shall sit in judgment,
and his dominion shall be taken away,
to be consumed and destroyed to the end.
27 And the kingdom and the dominion
and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole
heaven

﻿l'2'.s~2'mI of a Ram, a He-goat, am] (1 Horn I)A.\IIl~1I. S
9 Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew
exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and
toward the glorious land. mlt grew great, even to the host of
heaven; and some of the host of the stars it cast down to the
ground, and trampled upon them. H It magniﬁed itself, even
up to the Prince of the host; and the continual burnt offering
was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was
overthrown. 12 And the host was given over to it together with
the continual burnt offering through transgression;" and truth
was cast down to the ground, and the horn acted and pros-
pered. “ Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy
one said to the one that spoke, “For how long is the vision
concerning the continual burnt offering, the transgression that
makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host
to be trampled under foot?” " 1‘ And he said to him," “For two
thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then the
sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state.”
15 When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to under-
stand it; and behold, there stood before me one having the
appearance of a man. 16 And I heard a man’s voice between the
banks of the U'lai, and it called, “Gabriel, make this man
understand the vision.” 17 S0 he came near where I stood; and
when he came, I was frightened and fell upon my face. But he
said to me, “Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for
the time of the end."
18 As he was speaking to me, I fell into a deep sleep with
my face to the ground; but he touched me and set me on my
feet. '9 He said, “Behold, l will make known to you what shall
be at the latter end of the indignation; for it pertains to the
appointed time of the end. “As for the ram which you saw
with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia.
2‘ And the he-goat” is the king of Greece; and the great horn

and ordinances; ﬁwe have not listened to thy servants the
prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings, our princes,
and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. 7T0 thee, O
Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us confusion of face, as
at this day, to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of _leru—
salem, and to all lsrael, those that are near and those that are
far away, in all the lands to which thou hast driven them, be-
cause of the treachery which they have committed against thee.
8T0 us, O Lord, belongs confusion of face, to our kings, to our
princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against
thee. 9 To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness; be~
cause we have rebelled against him, wand have not obeyed
the voice of the LORD our God by following his laws, which he
set before us by his servants the prophets. “All Israel has
transgressed thy law and turned aside, refusing to obey thy
voice. And the curse and oath which are written in the law of
Moses the servant of God have been poured out upon us, be-
cause we have sinned against him. "He has conﬁrmed his
words, which he spoke against us and against our rulers who
ruled us, by bringing upon us a great calamity; for under the
whole heaven there has not been done the like of what has been
done against Jerusalem. “As it is written in the law of lVl0ses,
all this calamity has come upon us, yet we have not entreated
the favor of the LORD our God, turning from our iniquities and
giving heed to thy truth. 14 Therefore the LORD has kept ready
the calamity and has brought it upon us; for the LORD our
Cod is righteous in all the works which he has done, and we
have not obeyed his voice. “And now, O Lord our God, who
didst bring thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty
hand, and hast made thee a name, as at this day, we have
sinned, we have done wickedly. 1° O Lord, according to all thy
righteous acts, let thy anger and thy wrath turn away from

sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off, and shall
have nothing; and the people of the prince who is to come
shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its "i end shall come
with a Hood, and to the end there shall be war; desolations
are decreed. 27 And he shall make a strong covenant with many
for one week; and for half of the week he shall cause sacriﬁce

In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was
1 0 revealed to Daniel, who was named Belteshaz'zar.
And the word was true, and it was a great conﬂict. And he
understood the word and had understanding of the vision.
2 In those clays I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks. 31
ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I
anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks. 4 On the twenty—
fourth day of the ﬁrst month, as I was standing on the bank of
the great river, that is, the Tigris, SI lifted up my eyes and
looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were
girded with gold of Uphaz. “His body was like beryl, his face
like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like ﬂaming torches,
his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and the
sound of his words like the noise of a multitude. 7And I, Daniel,
alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not
see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they
fled to hide themselves. “So I was left alone and saw this great
vision, and no strength was left in me; my radiant appearance
was feartully changed, and I retained no strength. 9Then I
heard the sound of his words; and when I heard the sound of
his words, I fell on my face in a deep sleep with my face to the
ground.

﻿Between South and North Kingdoms DANIEL 11
1And as for me, in the ﬁrst year of Darius the Mede,
1 I I stood up to conﬁrm and strengthen him.
Z “And now I will show you the truth. Behold, three more
kings shall arise in Persia; and a fourth shall be far richer than
all of them; and when he has become strong through his riches,
he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece. 3 Then a
mighty king shall arise, who shall rule with great dominion and
do according to his will. 4 And when he has arisen, his kingdom
shall be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven,
but not to his posterity, nor according to the dominion with
which he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up and go to
others besides these.
5 “Then the king of the south shall be strong, but one of his
princes shall be stronger than he and his dominion shall be a
great dominion. “After some years they shall make an alliance,
and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the
king of” the north to make peace; but she shall not retain the
strength of her arm, and he and his offspring shall not endure;
but she shall be given up, and her attendants, her child, and he
who got possession of her.
7 “In those times a branch‘ from her roots shall arise in his
place; he shall come against the army and enter the fortress of
the king of the north, and he shall deal with them and shall
prevail. 8 He shall also carry off to Egypt their gods with their
molten images and with their precious vessels of silver and of
gold; and for some years he shall retrain from attacking the
king of the north. 9Then the latter shall come into the realm
of the king of the south but shall return into his own land.
1O “His sons shall wage war and assemble a multitude of
great forces, which shall come on and overthrow and pass
through, and again shall carry the war as far as his fortress.
“ Then the king of the south, moved with anger, shall come out

with him he shall act deceitfully; and he shall become strong
with a small people. Without warning 24 he shall come into the
richest parts ” of the province; and he shall do what neither
his fathers nor his fathers’ fathers have done, scattering among
them plunder, spoil, and goods. He shall devise plans against
strongholds, but only for a time. “And he shall stir up his
power and his courage against the king of the south with a
great army; and the king of the south shall wage war with an
exceedingly great and mighty army; but he shall not stand,
for plots shall be devised against him. 26 Even those who eat his
rich food shall be his undoing; his army shall be swept away,
and many shall fall down slain. 27 And as for the two kings, their
minds shall be bent on mischief; they shall speak lies at the
same table, but to no avail; for the end is yet to be at the time
appointed. Z8 And he shall return to his land with great sub-
stance, but his heart shall be set against the holy covenant. And
he shall work his will, and return to his own land.
29 “At the time appointed he shall return and come into the
south; but it shall not be this time as it was before. 3° For ships
of Kittim shall come against him, and he shall be afraid and
withdraw, and shall turn back and be enraged and take action
against the holy covenant. He shall turn back and give heed
to those who forsake the holy covenant. 31 Forces from him
shall appear and profane the temple and fortress, and shall
take away the continual burnt offering. And they shall set up
the abomination that makes desolate. “He shall seduce with
flattery those who violate the covenant; but the people who
know their Cod shall stand ﬁrm and take action. “And those
among the people who are wise shall make many understand,
though they shall fall by sword and flame, by captivity and
plunder, for some days. 34 When they fall, they shall receive a

between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall
come to his end, with none to help him.
“At that time shall arise Michael, the great prince
1 2 who has charge of your people. And there shall be a
time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation
till that time; but at that time your people shall be delivered,
every one whose name shall be found written in the book.
2And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall
awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and ever—
lasting contempt. 3And those who are wise shall shine like the
brightness of the ﬁrmament; and those who turn many to
righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever. 4 But you, Daniel,
shut up the words, and seal the book, until the time of the end.
Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase."
5 Then I Daniel looked, and behold, two others stood, one
on this bank of the stream and one on that bank of the stream.
“And In said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the
waters of the stream, “I-low long shall it be till the end of these
wonders?” 7The man clothed in linen, who was above the
waters of the stream, raised his right hand and his left hand
toward heaven; and I heard him swear by him who lives for
ever that it would be for a time, two times, and half a time;
and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people
comes to an end all these things would be accomplished. RI
heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, “Q my lord, what
shall be the issue of these things?” 9I-Ie said, “(lo your way,
Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of
the end. 1° Many shall purify themselves, and make themselves
white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and
none of the wicked shall understand; but those who are wise
shall understand. 11 And from the time that the continual burnt
