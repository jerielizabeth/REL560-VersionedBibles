Abraham (Abram) and the Covenant of Clrcumcislon.
8 “And 31 will give to you and to your ‘descendants after
you, the land of your soiournings, all the land of Canaan, for
an everlasting possession; and I will be their God."
9 Cod said further to Abraham, “Now as for you, “you
shall keep My covenant, you and your ldescendants after you
throughout their generations.
10 “=*This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between
Me and you and your ldescendants after you: every male
among you shall be circumcised.
11 “And "you shall be circumcised in the ﬂesh of your fore-
skin; and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and
you.
12 “And every male among you who is “eight days old shall
be circumcised throughout your generations, a servant who is
born in the house or who is bought with money from any
foreigner, who is not of your ldeseendants.
13 “A servant who is born in your house or “who is bought
with your money shall surely be circumcised; thus shall .\Iy
covenant be in your ﬂesh for an everlasting covenant.
14 “But an uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in
the ﬂesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut oﬂ from his
people; he has broken My covenant."
15 Then Cod said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife,
you shall not call her name Sarai, but lsarah shall be her name.
16 “And I will bless her, and indeed I will give you Ea son by
her. Then I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations;
bkings of peoples shall ‘come from her."
17 Then Abraham “fell on his face and laughed, and said
in his heart, “VVill a child be born to a man one hundred years
old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?"
18 And Abraham said to Cod, “Oh that Ishmael might
seen.m1@,z1.zbcm.zs.z. live before Thee!
5 ~~ ‘ .
19 But God said, No, but Sarah your wife shall bear you
aa son, and you shall call his name llsaac; and "I will establish
My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his
Zdeseendants after him.
20 “And as for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I will
bless him, and “will make him fruitful, and will multiply him
exceedingly. blde shall lbecome the father of twelve princes,
and I will make him a great nation.
21 “But My covenant I will establish with “Isaac, whom
Sarah will bear to you at this season next year."
ZZ“C¢"- 18133;35=13 22 And when He ﬁnished talking with him, "God went up
from Abraham.
23 Then Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all the ser—
vants who were "born in his house and all who were bought
with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's
household, and circumcised the ﬂesh of their foreskin in the
very same day, as Cod had said to him.
24 Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old when “he was
circumcised in the ﬂesh of his foreskin.
25 And alshmael his son was thirteen years old when he
was circumcised in the ﬂesh of his foreskin.
26 In the very same day Abraham was circumcised, and
Ishmael his son.

“laid it on Isaac his son, and he took in his hand the ﬁre and
